# LeakCheck

Bash script to check an email address or username against the haveibeenpwned.com database. 

Other than an active Internet connection, curl, cat and Bash or a bash compatible-shell installed, there are no other requirements for LeakCheck to run.

Results will be listed if an address or username has been included in a major data breach. If results are found, then an option to save a results file with details of the breach will be displayed.

Keep in mind. Repeated use in a short period of time may trigger haveibeenpwned.com to ratelimit you.
